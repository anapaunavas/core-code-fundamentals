**Date of birth ğŸ‘§**

Write pseudocode for an algorithm that calculates the age of a person based on date of birth

1. Ask for the date of birth and name the variable "date_of_birth".
2. Calculate the date of the day and name the variable "present".
3. Subtract the "date_of_birth" from the "present" to determine the age.
4. Print the result.
5. End


**Treasures ğŸ‘‘**

We are in a room with three chests. We know that at least one has a treasure in it. Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

Left chest: The middle chest has a treasure
Middle chest: All these chests have treasures in them
Right chest: Only one of these chests has treasures.

Which chests have treasures?

The answer is chest A and chest C, because due to the information given, none of the chest have treasure or left and right have treasures.
